# circles
* Use the numpad keys to move in cardinal and ordinal directions.
* m turns the music on and off
* p pauses and unpauses the game
* F1 gives a nasty surprise :)

You will need to download all the files, put them all in the same folder, and make sure you have python 3.8+ installed, along with pygame 2+. Then simply type circles.py to run the game.
